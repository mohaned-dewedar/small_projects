# AI and Data Science Learning Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my learning repository, a space where I document my ongoing journey through the fascinating worlds of artificial intelligence, data science, and data analysis. This repository serves as a digital lab notebook where I can capture my latest learnings, experiments, and projects.

## Repository Structure
Within this repository, you'll find various subfolders and files, each dedicated to specific topics or projects:

### Streamlit with Langchain (`Langchain/streamlit__with_agent`)
- **Overview**: This folder contains a project that illustrates how to integrate Streamlit with Langchain to create interactive web applications for AI powered Chatbot using OpenAI Functions.
- **Features**: Includes examples of generating dynamic plots and tables, showcasing the rapid prototyping capabilities of Streamlit and the language understanding prowess of OpenAI using the langchain framework.
- **Usage**: Ideal for those looking to see how language models can be applied in practical, user-facing applications.

### Langchain and OpenAI Functions Notebook (`Langchain/OpenAI_Functions_Agent.ipynb`)
- **Overview**: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of Langchain with OpenAI Functions to create smart agents, providing a hands-on approach to understanding how language models can be leveraged for retrieval tasks.
- **Contents**: Simple examples that show the interaction with OpenAI Chatgpt3.5 model that can be used to call APIs or query any database.
### EDA and Predictive Model for California Houses Dataset ('Simple_DS_Notebooks')
- **Overview**: 2 different Juypter Notebooks demonstrating my thought process while going through Exploratory Data Analysis and the full Machine Learning pipeline.

### Arabic Celebrities Classifier ('Arab_Celebrities/Data Gathering') (Still a Work in Progress)
- **Overview** : This folder implements a full process of gathering data and then using it to Build a Machine Vision Classifier using a CNN to classify the top 100 Arabic Celebrities.
- **Contents**: Scrapping Forbes 100 website to gather top 100 celebs, Using BingApi to gather images , Compressing the images and resizing them all. Perform EDA , Clearning and do Iterative Model Building (**Coming Soon**)

## Purpose
The content within this repository reflects a snapshot of my learning process. It is meant to be a personal knowledge base, as well as a portfolio of sorts that showcases my skills and interests in the field of AI.

## Contribution and Use
Feel free to explore the projects and code within this repository. If you have any suggestions or feedback, I'm open to collaboration. Keep in mind that this is a personal documentation repository, and the projects are tailored to my learning path.

## Future Work
As I continue to learn and grow in this field, expect to see this repository updated with new projects and more sophisticated examples of AI and data science applications.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find these resources helpful on your own AI and data science journey!
